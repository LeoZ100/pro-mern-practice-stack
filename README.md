# Developing the MERN stack

The my most envolving project yet, based on the book "Pro Mern Stack" by Vasan Subramanian (http://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484226520).

For this project, I developed an Issue list from the front end using React.js components, to the server done in Express.js, and then saved and later retrieved from a MongoDB database. Alongside, development tools like webpack, ESlint, nodemon, babel, react-bootstrap & others were utilized. 

Provided files: from scratch.
Project duration: 25 hours.
